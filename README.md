A silly, quick idea to render a webcam image using C64 glyphs.

C64 font courtesy of [Style](https://style64.org/c64-truetype), and Moon video courtesy of [APOD](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap130916.html).

Eventually I may make the selected glyph stay the same unless the value changes enough, but for now I'll just claim that the flickering is "temporal dithering" ðŸ™‚

If you want more lo-fi lunar goodness, I made a similar [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=42208) thing a few years back.
